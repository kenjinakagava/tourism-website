      <Paragraph>
        Brazil has tropical weather. The average annual temperature is 28째C in
        the North region and 20째C in the South of the country. Brazilian winter
        is between June and September, and in some cities in the South and
        Southeast of the country, temperatures drop below 0째C, with frost and
        snow. In the summer, it is possible to enjoy the 40째C heat in cities
        like Rio de Janeiro and Salvador, for example. Summer in Brazil is the
        best time to go to the beach, drink coconut water, swim in the sea, and
        sunbathe.

        When packing for your trip, please choose light and comfortable clothes.
        Items such as hats, caps, sunglasses, and sunscreen are useful to
        protect your skin from the sun. In forest areas, such as the Amazon and
        the Pantanal, we recommend the use of closed-toe shoes, long-sleeved
        t-shirts and shirts (preferably in light colors), long pants, and a hat
        to keep insects away.

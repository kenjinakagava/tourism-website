# Brazil Tourism Website

Welcome to the Brazil Tourism Website! This website was built using the following technologies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the frontend user interface
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for server-rendered React pages
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type-checking and improved code reliability
- [Styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for styling the website
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) for testing React components

## Why I built the project this way

I chose to use React for the frontend because it is a popular and powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Next.js for it's automatic image optimization. TypeScript was added for type-checking and to catch any potential errors before runtime. Styled-components was chosen for styling because it allows for easy management of component-specific styles. Jest and React Testing Library were added for thorough testing of the application.

## If I had more time, I would change this

If I had more time, I would like to add more features to the website such as a search bar to filter through different tourism destinations, a map to show the location of each destination, and the ability to book tours and accommodations directly through the website. I would also like to add more unit tests to increase the overall test coverage of the application.
